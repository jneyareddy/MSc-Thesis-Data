# MSc-Bioinformatics-Thesis-Data
This repository contains data from my MSc thesis in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology:
“Improving the genome annotations of non-Saccharomyces yeast and microalgal species.”

The study focuses on generating high-quality genome annotations for:

Torulaspora delbrueckii LO544

Lachancea thermotolerans IWBT Y1240

Chlorella sorokiniana

These species, with wine-related origins, play important roles in wine fermentation and winery wastewater biotechnology. Despite the availability of genomic data, recent annotation data for these strains is lacking, limiting the exploitation of other omics datasets and their biotechnological potential. This work aimed to address that gap by producing improved genome annotations.

**Contents**

**Significance**

These resources provide a foundation for future experimental and bioinformatics research aimed at leveraging the biotechnological applications of non-Saccharomyces yeasts and microalgal species.
