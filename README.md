# MSc-Thesis-Data
All data presented here is from my thesis, 'Improving the genome annotations of non-Saccharomyces yeast and microalgal speciesâ€™. It includes high-quality genome annotations for Torulaspora delbrueckii LO544, Lachancea thermotolerans IWBT Y1240 and Chlorella sorokiniana. 

MAKER-generated structural annotations can be found for each species. This entails GFF3 files for the final annotation (final consensus models), the evidences (the alignments MAKER used to construct the final annotation) and a file containing both the final annotation and evidences. 

eggNOG-mapper-generated functional annotations can also be found for each species. This is in the form of tab-delimited, and XLSX file format reports with the predicted functional terms per query. Gene Ontology (GO) terms, KEGG pathways and modules, and Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) functional categories along with the predicted protein names and the PFAM protein domains are described in these reports.
